### Project specs

You are working for a freelance developer. Clara Dunn is the founder of Watch it outside events Co. and is organizing an outdoor film festival in Boston this year called ‘Watch it outside Boston edition’. She hopes to select and show films from August 5th to 8th in Boston Public Garden, a park in Boston that can hold up to 1,500 people. �

She wants to create an event that shows that films can appeal to audiences of all ages, and she wants her advertisements and publications to reflect that same idea!

Clara has a budget of $3,500 to get the event website up and running. She needs to communicate online about her festival in order to announce the upcoming showings and take reservations!

She says 

"My company, "Watch it Outside" just got the approval to show movies in Boston Public Garden this year from August 5th through 8th, from 6pm to midnight. We can't wait to help the public discover awesome films!

I need to publicize the festival, and to do this, I need a website. On this site, I need to display information about the festival, the films we're showing, and regularly published news or announcements about the festival.

There should also be links to the city of Boston’s news website, the Boston Public Garden’s website, and our Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts somewhere on the page (navigation bar, footer links, etc). Since I haven't created these accounts yet, you can just have each social media icon as a link to its homepage (ex. https://twitter.com).

Shows will be free and open to everyone, but I want people to be able to pre-register so that I'm able to estimate how many people might come and so that we can close registration if it reaches the venue’s capacity of 1,500 people.

I'd like to have a professional web address, either a .com or .org -- you decide, but just make sure it's relevant to the film festival. However, until we are ready to launch, can you please make sure that the site is not made public or put online, I don’t want anyone signing up too early in case we change the schedule."
